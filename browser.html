      <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
      <p class="topic">Introduction to CSS!</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
In the first lesson, we were introduced to CSS for the first time. We were enlightened on its meaning and why we should use CSS. Also, Ms. Grace taught us about the layers of a webpage. She told us the 3 different layers: the content, presentation, and behavior layer and how they work and function together to make up a webpage. After learning about the layers one-by-one, we were finally enlightened on the benefits, capabilities, and advantages of using CSS in our work.

      <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
      <p class="topic">CSS Stylesheets!</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
In the next lesson, Ms. Grace further explained CSS. She told us about its structure and how the selector, property, and value work together. And of course, the types of stylesheets werr introduced to us. After learning about the 3 types: Embedded, Internal, and External Stylesheet, we were then taught how to code them and apply each.  We were taught each step carefully, from using the style tag to creating a CSS file. Everything was clear.

      <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
      <p class="topic">Display Property!</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
I would say Lesson 3 was quite simple. Again, the stylesheets were reviewed for futher understanding. Then the display property was made known to us. Also, Ms. Grace taught us how the Inline and Block-Level Elements worked. Lastly, we were taught of the <div> and <span> tag. It was explained to us that these tags do not have definite value and are used for sections.

      <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
      <p class="topic">Classes!</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
Lesson 4 was short. First, we were introduced to the CSS Rule. It has 2 main parts: a selector and one or more style declarations. Afterwards, it was explained to us how classes work and how they are denoted by a period (.). Then to further expand our knowledge, Ms. Grace taught us about Class Selectors work. It is when an element and a selector was put together. This was to specify which element you want to style. Lastly, we were introduced to the principle of grouping selectors. Grouping selectors with the same style declaration makes things easier by avoiding repeating declarations, and making things more organized.        </p>

      <h2>Lesson 5</h2>
      <p class="topic">Selectors!</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
This lesson was pretty simple. CSS Selectors are used to find or select the HTML Elements you want to style. Based on the lesson, there are 6 types: Class Selector, Element Selector, ID Selector, Universal Selector, Attribute Selector, and Group Selector. Each selector is different from the others. And there are certain times and circumstances on when certain selectors are to be used. Also, Ms. Grace showed us how the different selectors worked by coding them and seeing the output.

      <h2>Lesson 6</h2>
      <p class="topic">Setting Dimensions!</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
The last lesson, Lesson 6, was all about setting dimensions and pseudo-classes, and links. CSS can be used to manage dimensions like the visibility and the width, and height of an HTML element on a webpage. As for the pseudo-classes, they have 4 types: link, visited, hover, and active. The link pseudo-class is for when the link is not visited yet. The visited pseudo-class is for when the link has been visited. The hover pseudo-class is for when the user is hovering the link. And the active pseudo-class is for when the user currently has the link opened. And that basically compromises the last lesson.        </p>
